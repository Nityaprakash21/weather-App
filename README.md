- **Search Weather:** Allows users to search for weather details by entering a city's name.  
- **Weather Parameters:** Displays temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud coverage.  
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface with smooth transitions and loading indicators.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** â€“ For structuring the application.  
- **CSS** â€“ For styling the UI.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ For fetching and displaying weather data dynamically.  
- **OpenWeather API** (or any weather API) â€“ To retrieve real-time weather data.
